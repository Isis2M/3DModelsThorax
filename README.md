This Repository provides the 3D models obtained from the segmentation of Computed Tomography (CT) images of a 48-years-old female pantient, as well as the optimized 3D models. 

Both are free access, it is only requested that when using them you cite the article "3D model reconstruction from Computer Tomography (CT) scans using 3D Slicer: Optimization and Preparation for Mixed, Augment, and Virtual Reality applications". 

Note: Because of the file size of the original models is bigger than 25 GB, they are located in the following Drive folder:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHioLUemv7oLW71Rc3mZBZWeVoD9IMuR/view?usp=drive_link
